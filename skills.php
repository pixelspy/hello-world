            <p class="textskills"> <titlein>Digital media</titlein></br></br> It’s got to look and feel good. Armed with a rock solid strategy, our creatives make clever, striking and intuitive experiences that guide and engage your customer at every stage. We love beautiful things and unique technology. But you can trust that we create more than a pretty interface. From branding and design to customer journey and copy, everything in our creative process is executed with insight, purpose and a love of the craft.</p>

          <li><a href="#" class="titleskills">2. Video editing</a>
            <p class="textskills"><titlein>Video editing</titlein></br></br> We love technology. Our development team solves a multitude of clients’ problems in creative ways all day, then goes home and develops stuff for fun at night. Tech is our life, livelihood and love, married beautifully with design and purpose to stand out and transform your business.</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#" class="titleskills">3. 2D painting</a>
            <p class="textskills"><titlein>2D painting</titlein></br></br> As much as we love to create technology and experiences that stand out and capture an audience, everything we do needs to get the results you want. A great idea starts with a solid and insightful strategy based on the entire picture and an honest opinion. Our strategists get their kicks understanding your audience, market and objectives. And our creatives don’t touch a single pencil until you’re happy with the strategic foundation first.</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#" class="titleskills">4. 3D model making</a>
            <p class="textskills"><titlein>3D model making</titlein></br></br> Brands don’t talk at consumers anymore. They talk with them, and get them talking amongst themselves. Our social and content prowess ensures you share and engage with the right people and earn yourself some great advocates. We know where they are, how they communicate, and why they should be saying nice things about you and around you.</p>
          </li>
          <li><a href="#" class="titleskills">5. Game design</a>
            <p class="textskills"><titlein>Game design</titlein></br></br> The job isn’t over on launch day. Even the most amazing work means nothing if it’s not tracked, optimised and informing your next success. So we don’t just collect and crunch data – we figure out how and why something performed the way it did and tell you everything we know. Leave the analytics to us to make things better.</p>
